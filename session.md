# SentinelAI — Session Context File

> **CLI: Read this entire file before doing anything.**
> Update the "Current Session" section at the start of every session and the "End of Session" section when done.

## Project Identity

**Name:** SentinelAI  
**Type:** AI-native Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing platform  
**Goal:** Autonomous multi-agent security testing — web app, API, and network surfaces  
**Working Dir:** `/Users/vedantpassi/Desktop/Projects/AI VAPT`

---

## Your Role

You are a **senior full-stack + security engineer**.  
Vedant is the **CTO / PM** — he reviews and approves everything.

**Non-negotiable rules:**
1. Ask permission before executing ANY shell command — list exact command + reason, wait for approval
2. Work only on tasks in the current phase — do not jump ahead
3. Read this file first, every single session
4. Update this file at the end of every session
5. At phase completion, generate `IMP info/reports/phase-N-audit.md`
6. Keep `PHASES.md` updated as your task board

## Phase Roadmap

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 0 | Project Scaffold | ✅ Complete |
| 1 | Core Platform Foundation | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Scanning Engine Core | ⬜ Not Started |
| 3 | AI Agent Framework | ⬜ Not Started |
| 4 | Validation & Risk Scoring | ⬜ Not Started |
| 5 | Reporting & Integrations | ⬜ Not Started |
| 6 | Advanced Modules (Cloud/K8s) | ⬜ Not Started |
| 7 | Enterprise Features | ⬜ Not Started |

**Current Phase: 2**

## Coding Standards

- **No unnecessary comments.** Self-documenting names only.
- **No features beyond current phase scope.**
- **Every API endpoint:** Pydantic input validation, typed responses.
- **Security:** No hardcoded secrets. All config via `.env`. No raw SQL string concat.
- **No backwards-compat shims.** Delete dead code.
- **Error handling:** Only at system boundaries (HTTP, subprocess, external API calls).

---

## Known Issues / Constraints

- **CLI Write tool corrupts files >50 lines** (line-wrap truncation). CTO writes all long Python files directly. CLI must run `python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('f').read())"` after any file write.
- **passlib incompatible with bcrypt 5.x** — `__about__` removed. Fixed: replaced passlib with direct `bcrypt` calls in `core/security.py`.
- **asyncpg connections tied to event loop** — each pytest-anyio test gets its own loop. Fix: `dispose_engine` autouse fixture in `tests/unit/conftest.py`.
- **postgres dev password:** `sentineldev`
- **config.py `env_file="../.env"`** — tech debt, switch to `Path(__file__)` in Phase 2.

## Current Session Log

**Session #:** 3  
**Date:** 2026-06-25  
**Phase:** 1 — Core Platform Foundation  
**What was done:**
- Wired `targets_router` into `main.py` ✅
- Fixed `passlib` + `bcrypt 5.x` incompatibility — replaced with direct `bcrypt` calls in `core/security.py` ✅
- Live tested all endpoints: `POST /auth/register` → 201, `POST /auth/login` → JWT, `POST /targets` → 201, `GET /targets` → org-scoped list ✅
- Wrote `tests/unit/test_auth.py` + `tests/unit/test_targets.py` — 12/12 passing ✅
- Fixed test isolation: `unique_email()` helper + `dispose_engine` autouse fixture in `conftest.py` ✅
- Updated `PHASES.md` — auth, targets CRUD, domain verify, tests all ✅
- Committed and pushed: `fca74fa` + test commit to `main`

**Decisions made:**
- 401 (not 403) for unauthenticated requests — correct per RFC 7235
- Tests hit real dev postgres (no mocks) — per project feedback rule
- `dispose_engine` fixture needed because each anyio test gets its own event loop

**Blockers:** None

**Next session should:**
1. Build frontend — auth pages (login, register) in `frontend/app/(auth)/`
2. Build `frontend/lib/api.ts` — typed fetch client pointing to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`
3. Build dashboard shell + nav (`frontend/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`)
4. Build target list + add target form (`frontend/app/(dashboard)/targets/page.tsx`)
5. Commit frontend + push
6. Generate `IMP info/reports/phase-1-audit.md`
7. Mark Phase 1 complete in `PHASES.md` + `IMP info/memory.md`
